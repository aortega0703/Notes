With pictures and words, describe each symmetry in D3 (the set of symmetries of an equilateral triangle).
##### Solution:
- Mirror across line $1$:
	![[Mirror 1.png]]
- Mirror across line $2$:
	![[Mirror 2.png]]
- Mirror across line $3$:
	![[Mirror 3.png]]
- Rotate $0\degree$ (identity):
	![[Rotate 0.png]]
- Rotate $120\degree$:
	![[Rotate 120.png]]
- Rotate $240\degree$:
	![[Rotate 240.png]]
