[[Integers modulo n (set)]] is an [[Group|Abelian group]] under [[Modular addition properties|modular addition]].
##### Proof:
By [[Modular addition properties]] it satisfies associativity, existence of identity and inverses, and commutativity. Therefore $\mathbb{Z}/n$ is an Abelian group under modular addition.
