By [[Congruence under modulo is equivalence relation]] and [[Equivalence relation iff partition]], the equivalence classes of [[Congruence under modulo|congruence mod n]] partitions $\mathbb{Z}$ into modulo classes. This partition is denoted $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/n$, usually taken as only the representative elements ($0\leq k < n$).
