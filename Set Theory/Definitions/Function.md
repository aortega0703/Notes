For sets $A,B$
- A function $f:A\to B$ is a rule that assigns to each $a\in A$ exactly one $b\in B$ (in notation $f(a)=b$).
For a function $f:A\to B$ and some $a\in A$
- $A$ is called the _domain_ of $f$.
- $B$ is called the _range_ of $f$.
- $f(a)$ is called the _image_ of $a$ under $f$.
- $\{f(a)\in B: a\in A\}\subseteq B$  is called the image of $A$ under $f$.
For functions $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$
- The composition $g\circ f: A\to C$ is defined as $(g\circ f)(a)=g(f(a))$.
