For a function $f:A\to B$
- $f$ is _injective_ (often $f: A\hookrightarrow B$) when $f(a) = f(a') \implies a=a'$ for all $a\in A$.
- $f$ is _surjective_ (often $f: A\twoheadrightarrow B$) when for all $b\in B$, $b=f(a)$ for some $a\in A$.
- $f$ is a _bijection_/_isomorphism_ (often $f: A\overset{\sim}{\to}B$) if it is injective and surjective. If there exists an isomorphism between $A$ and $B$ they are said to be _isomorphic_ (often $A\cong B$).
